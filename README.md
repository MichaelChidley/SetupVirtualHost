SetupVirtualHost
================

This is a script I quickly wrote for me to be able to setup a virtual host quickly and easily. This has proven to be a very useful tool.

The program asks users to select what they want to setup, whether its a base domain or a sub domain - this does both. After the users has chosen the type, the program will ask for a little more information such who the domains email address should be. After this the script goes ahead and sets up the necessary files. It also creates the needed symbolic link to the sites_enabled folder.

This script was tested on:

Linux Kernal: 3.2.0-23-virtual
OS: Ubuntu 12.04
